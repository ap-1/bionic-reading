A working prototype is available [here]().

This project incorporates elements inspired by the Bionic Reading® method developed by BRCG Casutt GmbH. While not directly affiliated with Bionic Reading AG or BRCG Casutt GmbH, we acknowledge the innovative concepts and principles behind their work, which have influenced our project's design.

Mesh uses the vision capabilities of OpenAI's `gpt-4o` to extract text from images. Although it has been extremely reliable in testing, there is still a possibility of errors or hallucinations, particularly with complex or distorted images. Users are advised to exercise caution and verify the accuracy of transcribed text, especially for critical purposes.
